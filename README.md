# AngularSeed

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.7.

## How to get this seed in your machine
Make sure that you have **Node 10.9** or later and **NPM 6** or later installed.
> Clone the repo-
`git clone git@github.com:HorizonMedia/angular_seed.git`


## Development server

> Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

>__Note:__ To generate a component from CLI (_only for component_) must specify the root app module using this flag at the end `--module=app` 

For example to generate a post-list component `ng generate component post-list --module=app` OR `ng g c post-list --module=app`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Node Environment?
This seed was built on node version __10.13.0__.  If your local node version is 11 or more please download NVM(Node Version Manager) so that you can switch between node 10 and 11+ to avoid the **_node-sass_** issue. Here is the link and download [nvm-setup.zip](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)

> #### NVM Usage
1. `nvm list` (to see your available installed node versions)
2. `nvm list available` ( to see all the node versions available)
3. `nvm install 11.14.0` ( to install this specific version of node). 
4. `nvm use 11.14.0` (to use this specific node version locally)
